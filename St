Prepare a new disk for /tmp
Create LV on new disk (pvcreate, lvcreate)
pvcreate /dev/sdb
vgcreate vg_tmp /dev/sdb
lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n lv_tmp vg_tmp
Format LV with the filesystem of your choice
mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_tmp/lv_tmp
Mount it on a temporary mount
mount /dev/vg_tmp/lv_tmp /mnt
Copy data from /tmp directory to the new disk
cp -pr /tmp/* /mnt
ls -lrt /mnt
ls -lrt /tmp
Reboot server into single-user mode
Prepare new /tmp mount point
Delete/move existing /tmp directory depending on space availability in /
rm -rf /tmp OR
mv /tmp /tmp.orig
Create new /tmp for the mount point
mkdir /tmp
Set permission and ownership
chmod 1777 /tmp
chown root:root /tmp
Add entry in /etc/fstab
echo “/dev/vg_tmp/lv_tmp /tmp defaults 1 2″>>/etc/fstab
Reboot the server normally.
Log in and check /tmp is mounted as the separate mount point.
Setting up permission 1777 is an important step in this. Otherwise /tmp will not function as it is expected to.
